# Auto-Reconnect-to-Exchange
Powershell script to automatically reconnect to Exchange Online and Exchange on premises.

If you have to run a really long loop and query echange on prem or oline, often the connection will be broken
   by external forces such as proxy servers
   
Instead of you script crashing, it will auto reconnect.
